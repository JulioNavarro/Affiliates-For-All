Thank you for choosing Affiliates for All.

Affiliates for All is free software.  For licensing information, please see the
file called COPYING.  For legal notices concerning third party software, please
see doc/CREDITS.

Affiliates for All has a manual, which can be found at doc/manual.pdf.  This
PDF is created from an OpenDocument file called doc/manual.odt.  If you want to
change this, you will need OpenOffice.  The file was created with OpenOffice
3.0.0, and I would recommend that you use the same version.

If you modify the manual, please note that the screenshots are linked from
manual.odt, not incorporated in the file.  If you move manual.odt to a
different directory, the screenshots will probably stop working.

Erratum
-------

If you install the Magento integration, but it doesn't show up in
System/Configuration, you probably need to clear Magento's cache.

To clear the cache, go to System/Cache Management.  Under "All Cache" select
"Refresh".  Click "Save Cache Settings".

You should now log out and back in again, to force Magento to recalculate your
access rights (this is discussed in more detail in the manual).
